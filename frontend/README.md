![App Screenshot](frontend/public/image.png)

A modern, responsive multilingual translator built with **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project is designed as a university final project for an AI course and provides a user-friendly interface to translate text between many languages using a backend API route inside the same Next.js app.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application allows users to:
- Enter source text and choose a language to translate from
- Select a target language for translation
- Swap languages easily
- View translated output instantly
- See source and target language status in the header

The translator uses the `translate-google` package to perform translations on the server side through a Next.js API route.

## 📁 Structure

- `frontend/` — main application directory
  - `src/app/` — Next.js app pages and layout
  - `src/app/api/translate/route.ts` — translation API endpoint
  - `public/` — static assets including `lt_logo.png` and `image.png`

## 🛠️ Features

- Responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Modern glassmorphism UI with translucent cards and gradients
- In-app translation API route (`POST /api/translate`)
- Language swap button with auto-detect support
- Favicon and site logo integration
